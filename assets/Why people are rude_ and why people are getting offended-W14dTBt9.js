I have been thinking a lot about why people are like the way they are. 

Meaning some people tend to be rude when speaking. But not entirely rude. That is simply their way of speaking with others. 

My best friend is one of these kind of person. He is rude when speaking when others using bad words as a common thing. But he is not entirely rude. His speaking way is like that. Why, maybe he grew in such an environment, that made him act rude when speaking with others. 

But he is a nice guy when you know him. Sometimes I might get offended when someone i don't fully know speaks like that. I always try to be a kind of guy who everyone get speak without any worry of getting offended. 

Because my life is made mostly of people who rude enough to offend me every time. So i grow with the principle of don't try to offend anybody.

But that doesn't work in that every time, some one will always get offended by the things you speak or do. Because the situation I am in or they are in. 

So don't feel guilty of offending someone because you told them something they might get hurt emotionally. 

And also when someone is being rude, don't try to get hurt as well. Because they are just the way they are. So be happy that someone is comfortable enough to offend you. 

Most likely, you will feel insecure around them, or else your emotions will make you feel detached from the group they are with you want to be in. 

It always your choice whether you want get offended or not. You feel offended because you let the feeling take over you.

But why people are offending others?

In nature, that way of making there fact feel correct, in this case, their territory.
So they will act to make sure he is seen and dominated with the people around them. It's simple as that.

So don't worry when someone is speaking rudely, they are just insecure. 

Insecure enough to make their statement seen. Every person is insecure in some way are another. because human are social animal, we always want other people's acknowledgement every time to feel safe or to not get lonely even when people are around. 

So accept the fact that people are different. There is no fun if all the people in the world who don't offend anyone. 

That's what make us human.
