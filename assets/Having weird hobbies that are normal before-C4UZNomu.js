When talking about hobbies, lot of these reply you get nowadays are only watching instagram. 

The lack of hobbies is creating a pandamic in our creative world. Nowadays people don't feel like having to do things that are new. 

After finishing their work, they come to their home, and simply sit and scroll instagram. I am currently living among that kind of people. And making me sad as well as lonely. 

Not having a people who have the same enthusiasm as me. The people i am surrounded is rarely watching movies, heck even watching movies now considered as hobbies. That shouldn't be. 

Hobbies are the ones that make us creative and experience things. But today's society is filled with endless doomscrolling. They don't feel the need to experiment new things. 

The reason why hobbies exist is to cure boredom. Before the internet, when we are bored, we tend to do things to reduce boredom. Amd that made us creative and explore more areas of interest and be content with our lives with a sense of fulfillment. 

But now, that boredom was entirely filled with doom scrolling. What's the point of that, we certainly can't remember the content we saw 10 secs ago. Because we are always searching for new content to make hooked only to be swept away by another content few second after.

It was not our fault scientifically. We have a brain of a monkey. That means we always look for something more than be content with our lives. That's how evolution made us survive. Or else we would be extinct by now. If we don't adapt.  

But now, that very concept is turned into a different story. People are not really having any hobbies. They simple exist to scroll. 

I always think about i am the one who is having different interest and different hobbies. I always looking forward to explore more in many kinds of genres.

I have interest in books, stories, drawings, writings, mythology, gaming and many more. And seek to learn more. 

In the world full of people scrolling, i am here simply experiencing all kinds of feeling when learning something wonderful. 

I kind of feel special and grateful to have this opportunity to learn and experience everything. 

And kind of want other people to experience this things also. Time will tell.
