Sometimes, I wonder how some people is able to do some things better compared to others ,in this case, me. Like speaking english fluently and speaking with girls easily and many more example even i can't help but wonder how could they do it easily. 

Then I realised one thing, compared to last year. I also improved a lot in certain ways. I noticed one thing, when you experience the thing your not familiar with and it make you uncomfortable. After sometime, It makes the situation easier to tackle.

One example is, last year, When i was preparing for placement interview. I am concurrently preparing to speak English by speaking into the voice recorder for myself only. The reason why i couldn't improve my english there, is because I didn't have the uncomfortable experience of putting my comfort mind in the unexplored area to learn from mistakes. 

Then, when I joined this company, my manager is happens to be north indian, so he can't speak tamil. Only way to communicate with him is to speak in english. At first I struggles a lot to speak fluently and got uncomfortable. Then i slowly started connecting my words together in a way that's fluent. And eventually, another guy joined this company, who is also don't speak tamil, because he is malayali. So I started talking with him as well. Only difference between my manager and this guy is the tone of speaking. I can't speak casually with my manager, we have to speak professionally there. But when i am with this guy, i can speak all the things from philosophy to entertainment. And this guy is good at listening and had a ability to have a conversation going. I went through a lot of trail and error. Then i finally got fluent in speaking English.

Another example, speaking with girls, I can say, it's more about the opportunity than being afraid of speaking with them. I know a lot of woman from my sister to cousins, who are all around my age. The problem i don't have a lot of girl friends is because of department. I simply don't have much to speak with them, only three girls are there in my department. I don't know what to speak with them. Then in my 8th semester, i finally gathered the courage to speak with them and got them join my team for that semester project. But it was too late. After sometime, I joined the company as an intern. So i can't speak with them face to face. Only through phone. But that gave one advantage of getting comfortable speaking with them without having to face them. 

And then I came to realise, . I can have speak whatever i speak with boys i can speak with girl as well. Only gender is different. They are also like us boys. Then, I got more opportunity to speak with girls in this company. 

And now i am not afraid to speak with girls. I simply started getting comfortable to speak with them. 

When i was looking back, whatever I thought it was never going to happen last year. It became normal this year. My conclusion is two things, one is opportunity, and another one is getting myself uncomfortable.

Whenever you have these two, you can get better at the thing you want achieve.

PS: Sometimes looking back to see how much you have grown makes me feel good.`;export{e as default};
