Recently I have been wondering if i say no to everything, would I regret it later?.

My friends are going out everyday even the weekdays when they know they will be tired tomorrow. But they still go out. But mostly to eat non veg dishes and play in a turf nothing more to explore. But they still spend time in the outside. 

And here I am, Being in home reading, writing, building some project or simply watching movies. 

Sometimes I wonder can i go with them to experience the things they are experiencing. But my mind will say you will be tired tomorrow at work. Actually my mind is saying true, I am currently doing a project of own in my company. Nobody is there for me to support it or take care if things go wrong. I am the sole responsible for the project. So I need to be fresh, then only can i meet the people responsible for the tasks.  I know my friends is also working, but they have their seniors to cover for them.

If I don't take enough rest, my mind will become fuzzy, I'll just waste the whole day. So I will be in my home doing things that do not tire me. Like reading, writing code and watching movies. 

But then what's the point if i don't enjoy myself when i have a chance. But I am currently in phase of self improvement, from increasing my skill level to become understand that make me question things. 

I want to experience things from all sorts of things from life. Exploring the world is one thing. But simply exploring the same thing again and again will not make life worth living. 

I have been experimenting a lot of things from exercise to writing to coding. So that I can create something that are useful for others. 

There's theory why art exist. people create things because they want to leave behind a thing that exist even after their death. And they hope that thing will make others remind them. The art lives even after the death of the artist. 

I currently in that experiment phase, try different thing and find the one your good at. And make something useful that will be help ful to other people. 

But I know, I need to live as well. Not be man who wasted their 20s trying to live up to the expectation of others. Who always thinks of ways to deflect the opportunity that make life fun. 

That's why currently starting say yes to most things when somebody suddenly ask me to go with them somewhere. Because unplanned trips are always better than the planned trip. 

I am not going to lie, This year's been a banger for me. The year started with festival in college to hills to shifting cities to moving rooms. I enjoyed a lot as well as learned a lot along the way. I don't want to regret not enjoying as well as doing anything meaningful that make me identify my purpose. 

Living with low regret is my current goal. I currently working on it. We will see how life takes me to.
